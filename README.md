# PaperRockScissors CNN

-------

A notebook of hand's image recognition that gesturing paper, rock, and scissors using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with keras and tensorflow. This ML project is for my final submission for Dicoding ML class.

## Dataset Source

-------
I am using data from [Dicoding](https://dicodingacademy.blob.core.windows.net/picodiploma/ml_pemula_academy/rockpaperscissors.zip) website, but it seems the data itself fetched from external source.
