# Paper Rock Scissors Prediction

-------

A notebook of hand's image recognition that gesturing paper, rock, and scissors using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with keras and tensorflow. This ML project is my final submission for [Dicoding](https://dicoding.com) beginner ML certification class.

This notebook was made with [Google Collaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/).

## Dataset Source

-------
I am using data from [this](https://dicodingacademy.blob.core.windows.net/picodiploma/ml_pemula_academy/rockpaperscissors.zip) Dicoding website, but it seems the data itself fetched from external source.

## External Library Used

-------

1. Tensorflow
2. Keras
3. Matplotlib
4. Numpy
5. Split-folders
6. Google Collab library
