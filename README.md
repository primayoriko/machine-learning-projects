# PaperRockScissors CNN

This ML project is for my final submission for Dicoding ML class.

## Dataset Source

-------
I am using data from [dicoding](https://dicodingacademy.blob.core.windows.net/picodiploma/ml_pemula_academy/rockpaperscissors.zip), but it seems the data itself fetched from external source.

## External Library Used

-------

1. Tensorflow
2. Keras
